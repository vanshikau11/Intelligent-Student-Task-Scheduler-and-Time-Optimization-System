# Intelligent Student Task Scheduler and Time Optimization System

The Intelligent Student Task Scheduler and Time Optimization System is a C-based application designed to help
students manage their academic tasks efficiently. The system enables users to create, update, delete, and
complete tasks while automatically organizing them based on priority, deadlines, and dependencies.

The project focuses on the practical application of core data structures and algorithms to build a real-world,
user-friendly productivity system.

## Features

- Add, delete, edit, and mark tasks as completed
- Priority-based and deadline-aware task scheduling
- Undo and redo functionality for task operations
- File handling for persistent task storage
- Progress tracking with completion reports
- Chart-based analytics for productivity visualization
- Graph-based task dependency representation
- Depth First Search (DFS) traversal to analyze task dependencies and execution flow
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy navigation and interaction

## Purpose of the Project

This project was developed as an academic and practical implementation of data structures and algorithms.
It demonstrates how linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs, and DFS traversal can be combined to solve real-world
problems such as task scheduling, dependency management, and productivity analysis.

The system aims to improve student productivity by providing intelligent scheduling, visual analytics, and
an interactive user interface in a single integrated solution.
